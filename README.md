Hi! I'm a game dev student and also and also an artist. This profile is currently under construction. For now I'll just link some other platforms I use

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rionisguild)
- [Telegram art channel](https://t.me/rionisguild)
- [itch.io](https://rioni.itch.io/)

I don't currently have more medias I use actively

For code projects just check my repos, they are mostly public simple games, little tools and websites. 
I also took part in the creation a gaem engine called [Aegis](https://github.com/Proyecto3Grupo02/Aegis/tree/main)
